# CSCI115GroupProject

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to perform analysis on different sorting algorithms by measuring the time taken for different inputs sizes. This was then plotted to show the difference between theoretical estimates versus real-world time taken. The two sum problem was also given to be solved and compare run times of different solutions. A slideshow and video were then created with the results which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LHEhMkKauvrjQcCQ5uFS5jrMVFuqXj6e/view?usp=sharing).
