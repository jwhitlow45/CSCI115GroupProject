The files "radixSort.h" and "countingSort.h" contain defined functions pertaining to those relevant sorting methods. 
Each function has identical parameters, an int array, and and int that denotes the number of elements 
inside that array. 

Functions modify the given array via pass-by-reference, and do not return any explicit data.

radixSort.h contains an overloaded method, that is designed to use another identically named function that does the actual sorting. 
The overloaded function dynamically allocates and de-allocates memory as it executes, since the functions trade off efficient memory
for speed.
